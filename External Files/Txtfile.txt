Dearest Major Gilbert,
Please forgive me for visiting you so suddenly.
I promise: this is my last letter to you.
You won't hear from me again.
The reason I'm alive today, and (A) the reason I learned how to love others, is all thanks to you.
You were the first person to accept me. I want to thank you for that.
Thank you for reading to me and for showing me how to read.
You taught me so much. I would like to thank you for that as well.
Thank you for buying the brooch for me. I will cherish it forever.
I want to thank you for always, no matter what, keeping me by your side.
Thank you for giving me those words — "I love you."
Hearing you tell me "I love you" — it’s become a guiding light for my life.
Now, since I've learned what those words mean, (B) I wanted to tell you that I love you, too.
Major, you changed my life for more than you will ever know.
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

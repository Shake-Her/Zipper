A Data Compression Tool (Cpp)


> TO RUN LOCALLY ON YOUR DEVICE  :

```
-- Open your Terminal make sure you a working cpp environment on your system.
-- cd to Souce folder
-- g++ main.cpp this will generate a a.exe file
-- on this step just type a.exe and press enter
-- after this my program will perfectly guide to the output step by step

NOTE: This data compression Technique is based of Huffman Coding algorithm and it's an One pass Code where encoding and Decoding will be 
      done on single run only ggs :)
